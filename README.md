[![ci](https://github.com/kthcloud/sys-api/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kthcloud/sys-api/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml)

This API is used to fetch capacities, usage and other information about the kthcloud system.

It does this by fetching information from every host
(using the [host-api](https://github.com/kthcloud/host-api) installed locally) and Kubernetes clusters

## 📚 Docs
This API is documented using Swagger.

You can view the publically hosted documentation [here](https://api.cloud.cbh.kth.se/landing/v2/docs/index.html).

## 🤝 Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing!

Right now we don't support running the API outside kthcloud.
But if you are part of the development team at kthcloud,
you can find the current configuration file with the required secrets in our private admin repository.
